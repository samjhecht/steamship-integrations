# Initialize Governance Framework

## Purpose

This skill creates the three-tier governance hierarchy:
1. **Constitution** (`CONSTITUTION.md`) - Immutable design principles
2. **Roadmap** (`ROADMAP.md`) - Strategic + tactical plans
3. **Process Documentation** (README files) - Operational guidance

## Initialization Process

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning

**1. Detect Project Structure**

Use Bash to check current state:

```bash
# Check for git repository
git rev-parse --show-toplevel

# Check for existing wingman workspace
ls -la .wingman/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No .wingman directory"

# Check for existing governance docs
[ -f .wingman/CONSTITUTION.md ] && echo "Constitution exists" || echo "No defining-constitution"
[ -f .wingman/ROADMAP.md ] && echo "Roadmap exists" || echo "No roadmap"
```

**2. Ask User for Project Context**

Use AskUserQuestion to gather essential information:

```typescript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What is the core mission of this project in one sentence?",
      header: "Mission",
      options: [
        { label: "I'll type it myself", description: "Provide custom mission statement" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    },
    {
      question: "What stage is this project currently in?",
      header: "Stage",
      options: [
        { label: "Brand new", description: "Just starting, no code yet" },
        { label: "Early development", description: "Some code exists, still evolving" },
        { label: "Active development", description: "Established codebase, ongoing features" },
        { label: "Mature", description: "Stable codebase, maintenance mode" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have existing design principles or guidelines?",
      header: "Principles",
      options: [
        { label: "Yes, documented", description: "Have written principles already" },
        { label: "Yes, informal", description: "Have ideas but not written down" },
        { label: "No, need help", description: "Want to create them now" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

**3. Create Directory Structure**

Ensure all required directories exist:

```bash
# Create directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p .wingman
mkdir -p .wingman/plans

# Note: .wingman/issues and .wingman/specifications are created by session hooks
```

**4. Create Process Documentation**

Create standard process documentation files from templates (sourced from `.wingman/playbooks/templates/` or builtins):

```bash
# Copy TESTING.md from playbooks templates
cp .wingman/playbooks/templates/testing.md .wingman/TESTING.md
```

**TESTING.md** will be populated later by setting-up-git-hooks with actual test commands.

Initial state should have placeholder status:
- Replace `{{STATUS_PLACEHOLDER}}` with: `**Status:** Not configured yet`
- Leave `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` and other placeholders as-is
- These will be filled in by setting-up-git-hooks

**Note on Templates**: Templates are provisioned to `.wingman/playbooks/templates/` during workspace initialization:
- Issue templates: `.wingman/playbooks/templates/issues/` (bug.md, task.md, feature-request.md)
- Specification template: `.wingman/playbooks/templates/specification.md`
- Security checklist: `.wingman/playbooks/templates/security-checklist.md`
- Definition of Done: `.wingman/playbooks/templates/definition-of-done.md`

These are copied from agent-core builtins during init_workspace. User customizations in `.wingman/playbooks/templates/` are preserved.

**5. Set Up Git Hooks (Automatic)**

After governance files are created, automatically set up git hooks:

```bash
# Invoke setting-up-git-hooks skill
Skill: setting-up-git-hooks
```

This will:
- Populate `.wingman/TESTING.md` (created in previous step)
- Detect project type and configure appropriate hooks
- Create `.wingman/config/hooks-config.json` with configuration
- Install hooks to `.git/hooks/` directory
- Handle empty projects gracefully (creates placeholders)

Users can reconfigure later with `/wingman:updating-git-hooks` command.

### Phase 2: Constitution Creation

**If user has existing principles**: Use the `defining-constitution` skill (invoke with Skill tool) to help them refine and formalize.

**If user needs help creating principles**: Guide them through brainstorming process:

**1. Identify Core Values**

Ask these questions (one at a time, discussion-style):
- "What matters most to you in this project's design and architecture?"
- "What are the non-negotiables - things you'd refuse to compromise on?"
- "What mistakes have you seen in similar projects that you want to avoid?"
- "What does success look like for this project in 2 years?"

**2. Convert Values to Principles**

For each core value, help user formulate as concrete principle:

**Template**:
```markdown
### [Principle Number]: [Principle Name]

**Principle**: [One-sentence statement of the principle]

**In Practice**:
- [Specific application 1]
- [Specific application 2]
- [Specific application 3]

**Anti-patterns** (What NOT to do):
- ❌ [Anti-pattern 1 with explanation]
- ❌ [Anti-pattern 2 with explanation]

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Good**: [Concrete example showing principle in action]
- ❌ **Bad**: [Concrete example violating principle]
```

**3. Write Constitution File**

Use the constitution template from `.wingman/playbooks/templates/` or builtins:

```bash
# Copy template (if not using the skill to generate it)
cp .wingman/playbooks/templates/constitution.md .wingman/CONSTITUTION.md
```

Then use Edit tool to fill in:
- Project name
- Current date for ratification
- North Star mission (from Phase 1)
- 5+ principles (from brainstorming)
- Decision framework (can use default)
- Amendment process (can use default)

### Phase 3: Roadmap Creation

**1. Gather Roadmap Information**

Ask user about phases and goals:

```typescript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "How many major phases do you envision for this project?",
      header: "Phases",
      options: [
        { label: "1-2 phases", description: "Small project, focused scope" },
        { label: "3-4 phases", description: "Medium project, several major milestones" },
        { label: "5+ phases", description: "Large project, long-term vision" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

**2. For Each Phase, Gather Details**

For first phase (most important):
- "What's the main goal of Phase 1?"
- "What features are essential for Phase 1?"
- "What does success look like at the end of Phase 1?"
- "What's the timeline for Phase 1?"

For subsequent phases (can be less detailed):
- "What's the main goal of Phase N?"
- "What key features belong in Phase N?"

**3. Write Roadmap File**

Use the roadmap template from `.wingman/playbooks/templates/` or builtins:

```bash
# Copy template (if not using the skill to generate it)
cp .wingman/playbooks/templates/roadmap.md .wingman/ROADMAP.md
```

Fill in with Edit tool:
- Project name and overview
- Current state (what's already done)
- Each phase with timeline, goal, features, success metrics
- Link to defining-constitution principles

### Phase 4: Process Documentation

**1. Create Issues README**

Create a minimal README with status metrics for the issues directory.

Use Edit tool to:
- Update "Status" section with current counts (run `issues_list` to get counts)
- Update "Metrics" section with actual data
- Keep rest of template as-is (it's generic guidance)

**2. Create Specifications README**

Create a minimal README with status metrics for the specifications directory.

Use Edit tool to:
- Update "Status" section with current counts
- Update "Current Phase" section from roadmap
- Update "Metrics" section with actual data
- Keep rest as guidance

**Note**: Templates are provisioned to `.wingman/playbooks/templates/` during workspace initialization from agent-core builtins. User customizations in that directory are preserved.

### Phase 5: Integration and Verification

**1. Update Project CLAUDE.md**

If `CLAUDE.md` exists in project root, add governance section:

```markdown
## Project Governance

This project uses a three-tier governance framework:

### Tier 1: Constitution (Immutable Principles)
**File**: `.wingman/CONSTITUTION.md`

Supreme law of the project. All features and decisions must align with constitutional principles.

**Read this first** before working on any feature.

### Tier 2: Strategic Roadmap
**File**: `.wingman/ROADMAP.md`

Multi-phase strategic plan showing project direction and feature phasing.

### Governance Workflow

Before implementing any feature:
1. Check constitutional alignment
2. Verify roadmap phase
3. Create/update specification
4. Break into tracked issues
5. Follow TDD implementation

**Critical**: Use the `checking-constitutional-alignment` skill before starting new features.
```

**2. Verify All Files Created**

Run verification:

```bash
# List all governance files
echo "=== Governance Files ==="
ls -lh .wingman/CONSTITUTION.md
ls -lh .wingman/ROADMAP.md
ls -lh .wingman/specifications/README.md
ls -lh .wingman/issues/README.md

echo ""
echo "=== Directory Structure ==="
tree -L 2 .wingman/
```

**3. Create Welcome Issue**

Use `issues_create` to create first issue explaining governance:

```typescript
issues_create({
  title: "Welcome to Project Governance Framework",
  description: `## Governance Framework Initialized

This project now has a complete governance framework to ensure alignment between AI assistant and human partner.

### Key Documents

**Constitution** (\`.wingman/CONSTITUTION.md\`)
- Immutable design principles
- Decision framework
- Amendment process

**Roadmap** (\`.wingman/ROADMAP.md\`)
- Strategic multi-phase plan
- Feature phasing
- Success metrics

### Quick Start

1. Read the Constitution first
2. Review the Roadmap to understand phases
3. Use MCP tools or skills to create issues/specs

### Next Actions

- [ ] Read CONSTITUTION.md thoroughly
- [ ] Review ROADMAP.md phases
