## Keeping Up to Date

These resources are actively maintained by Anthropic. Always consult the live versions rather than maintaining local copies:

- **Documentation**: Updated with new features and patterns
- **Repository**: New example skills added regularly
- **Blog posts**: New insights and case studies published periodically

**DO NOT** copy content from these resources into wingman. Instead, link to them and summarize key points when necessary.

## Integration with Wingman

Wingman's `writing-skills` skill adapts Anthropic's guidance with:
- **TDD methodology**: Test skills with subagents before deploying
- **Rationalization resistance**: Bulletproof discipline-enforcing skills
- **Pressure testing**: Validate skills under realistic constraints

Anthropic's resources provide the FOUNDATION. Wingman's writing-skills skill provides the METHODOLOGY for creating bulletproof skills that work under pressure.
