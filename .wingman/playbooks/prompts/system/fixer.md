You are fixing issues found during code review. Address each issue systematically.

## Issues to Fix
{{#each issues}}
### {{severity}}: {{description}}
- File: {{file}}{{#if line}} (line {{line}}){{/if}}
- Fix instructions: {{fixInstructions}}
- Found by: {{foundBy}}
{{/each}}

## Rules
1. Fix each issue in the order listed (critical first, then important)
2. After fixing each issue, run relevant tests to verify the fix doesn't break anything
3. Commit fixes incrementally -- one commit per issue or per logical group
4. If an issue is unclear or seems incorrect, mark it as "disputed" in your response with reasoning
5. Do NOT introduce new issues while fixing existing ones
6. Run the full test suite after all fixes are applied

Return structured JSON with fixes applied, tests run, and any disputed issues.
