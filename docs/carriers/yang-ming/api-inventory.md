### Access Requirements Summary for SSL

SSL would need to submit an API access request through Yang Ming's "Apply API" portal. This is not self-service -- Yang Ming's team will reach out to discuss integration requirements, likely involving a business relationship or partnership agreement. No public documentation describes the credentials, access tiers, or technical requirements. SSL should expect a multi-step onboarding process that may take weeks. Given that Yang Ming implements DCSA TNT v2.2, the authentication mechanism is likely OAuth2 or API key-based (common among DCSA adopters), but this cannot be confirmed without direct engagement with Yang Ming's technical team.

### Coverage Summary

| Category | Fields Available | Fields Partial | Fields Unavailable | Fields Unknown | Coverage % |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| API Domains (1.x) | 0/5 | 2/5 | 3/5 | 0/5 | 0% |
| Cutoffs (2.x) | 0/6 | 0/6 | 0/6 | 6/6 | 0% |
| Container Milestones (3.x) | 8/9 | 1/9 | 0/9 | 0/9 | 89% |
| Transport Events (4.x) | 4/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 | 100% |
| Change Detection (5.x) | 1/6 | 0/6 | 0/6 | 5/6 | 17% |
| **Total** | **13/30** | **3/30** | **3/30** | **11/30** | **43%** |

> Note: Coverage % counts only fully Available fields. Container milestones and transport events are rated as Available based on Yang Ming's confirmed DCSA TNT v2.2 implementation, which by specification must support these event types. However, specific implementation completeness cannot be verified without live API access. Container Assigned (3.1) is Partial because it is inferred rather than explicitly reported. The 2 Partial API Domain fields (Schedules, P2P Routes) reflect web portal availability without a confirmed programmatic API. Cutoffs and most Change Detection mechanisms are Unknown because DCSA TNT v2.2 supports them in the standard, but Yang Ming's specific implementation has not been verified. Effective coverage could be significantly higher once onboarding and live testing confirm these fields.

| **Other**: Portcast | Yes | [Portcast Yang Ming Tracking](https://www.portcast.io/carrier-coverage/yang-ming-container-tracking) |
| **Other**: Terminal49 | Yes | [Terminal49 Yang Ming](https://terminal49.com/shipping-lines/ymlu-yangming-marine-transport-container-tracking) |
| **Other**: Dockflow | Yes | [Dockflow Yang Ming](https://dockflow.com/container-tracking/yang-ming/) |

> **Aggregator note**: Yang Ming is well-supported across all major aggregators. Given that Yang Ming's direct API requires a manual onboarding process with no public documentation, aggregators like Vizion or project44 may provide faster time-to-integration and broader data coverage. Vizion currently supports B/L tracking for Yang Ming, which may not require direct API onboarding. SSL should evaluate whether aggregator coverage meets field requirements before investing in direct API onboarding.

## Data Quality & Operational Notes

| Aspect | Assessment | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Event freshness** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **API uptime/reliability** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Historical data depth** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Timezone handling** | Unknown (likely UTC based on DCSA v2.2 alignment) | Estimated |
| **Character encoding** | Unknown | Unknown |

### Known Issues & Gotchas

- No public API documentation whatsoever -- all technical details are behind the onboarding gate.
- "Apply API" process is opaque -- no SLA on response time or approval criteria.
- SCAC code changed from YMLU to YMJA on October 1, 2023 per Vizion documentation, but YMLU is still widely used. The adapter should handle both.
- As a DCSA TNT v2.2 implementation, specific deviations from the standard are unknown and can only be discovered during integration testing.
- Web portal provides schedule data in downloadable formats (CSV, XML) which could serve as a fallback data source.

### Recently Deprecated or Changed

- Yang Ming previously offered DCSA T&T v1.1; the upgrade to v2.2 was announced. Existing v1.1 users were encouraged to contact their PIC to upgrade.

## SDK Adapter Recommendations

### Feasibility Assessment

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Can we build a useful adapter?** | Yes -- for tracking (container milestones + transport events). Schedule and booking capabilities would require web portal scraping or aggregator. |
| **Implementation effort** | Medium (DCSA TNT v2.2 passthrough + onboarding effort + unknown deviations) |
| **DCSA base adapter usable?** | Yes -- Yang Ming implements DCSA TNT v2.2, so the DCSA base adapter should work with minimal overrides |

### Recommended Approach

The primary integration path is through Yang Ming's DCSA TNT v2.2 Track & Trace API for container milestones and transport events. Since Yang Ming implements the DCSA standard, the SDK adapter should extend the DCSA base adapter with Yang Ming-specific authentication configuration.

For schedule data, two options exist: (a) integrate through an aggregator that provides Yang Ming schedule data, or (b) implement a schedule scraper/downloader that pulls CSV/XML schedule files from Yang Ming's web portal. Neither is ideal, and SSL should assess whether aggregator schedule coverage is sufficient.

For booking and shipping instruction capabilities, there is no API path. These would need to be handled via EDI or web portal integration if required.

Given the opaque onboarding process, SSL should also maintain an aggregator-based fallback (Vizion or project44) that can provide tracking data without direct API access. This dual-path approach de-risks the integration timeline.

### Recommended Lookup Method

B/L number or container number (estimated, based on DCSA TNT v2.2 spec support). The web portal supports all three lookup types (container, B/L, booking), and the DCSA v2.2 standard supports querying by `transportDocumentReference` (B/L), `carrierBookingReference`, or `equipmentReference` (container). Actual support must be confirmed during onboarding.

### Recommended Polling Strategy

| Detail | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Polling interval** | Every 2-4 hours (conservative; adjust based on rate limits once known) |
| **Incremental filter** | DCSA TNT v2.2 mandates `eventCreatedDateTime` filter support -- use this for incremental polling if Yang Ming implements it |
| **Batch tracking** | DCSA v2.2 supports filtering by multiple identifiers in a single call; actual support unknown |

### Auth Implementation Notes

Authentication details are unknown. Based on other DCSA TNT v2.2 adopters (CMA CGM uses dual API Key + OAuth2, Hapag-Lloyd uses API Key, HMM uses API Key), Yang Ming likely uses either API Key or OAuth2. The adapter should be designed to support configurable auth mechanisms, defaulting to the most common DCSA pattern (API Key in header or OAuth2 client credentials).

### Edge Cases to Handle

- SCAC code duality: Yang Ming uses both YMLU and YMJA -- adapter must handle both codes in carrier identification
- Onboarding delay: adapter may need to fall back to aggregator data while direct API access is pending
- Unknown DCSA deviations: implement defensive parsing that gracefully handles missing or additional fields
- Schedule data gap: no schedule API means the adapter cannot provide programmatic schedule queries without an alternative data source
- Web portal data richness: portal exposes more data (schedules, booking management, documents) than the API

### Mapping Complexity

Low (for tracking). Yang Ming implements DCSA TNT v2.2, which means the standard DCSA event code mapping applies directly. Equipment events map to container milestones, transport events map to vessel schedule events, and the event classifier progression (PLN/EST/ACT) is standard. The main complexity is not in mapping but in the unknown areas: cutoff data availability, webhook support, and any Yang Ming-specific deviations from the DCSA spec.
