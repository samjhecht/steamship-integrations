## Authentication & Access

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Auth mechanism** | Unknown — developer portal has a dedicated "API Auth" page at https://developers.one-line.com/api-auth but content was not accessible via web fetch (SPA-rendered) |
| **Auth documentation** | https://developers.one-line.com/api-auth (requires registration/portal access) |
| **Registration process** | Create an account on the developer portal. Further steps unknown |
| **Registration URL** | [https://developers.one-line.com/get-started](https://developers.one-line.com/get-started) |
| **Partner program required?** | Unknown — portal language says "Start by creating an account, seeing our full API" which suggests some level of self-service, but whether a business relationship is required for production access is not confirmed |
| **Partner program URL** | N/A |
| **Credential type** | Unknown |
| **Token refresh supported?** | Unknown |
| **Token lifetime** | Unknown |
| **Access tiers** | Unknown |
| **IP whitelisting required?** | Unknown |

### Access Requirements Summary for SSL

ONE has a developer portal at developers.one-line.com, which is a positive sign for API accessibility. However, the portal is SPA-rendered and the specific registration process, authentication mechanism, and access requirements could not be determined without creating an account. SSL should register on the developer portal to assess the full API product catalog, authentication requirements, and any business relationship prerequisites. Given that ONE is a DCSA founding member and publicly advertises API access, the barrier to entry may be lower than carriers like MSC that require formal partner onboarding. However, this is speculative until portal registration is completed.

### Coverage Summary

| Category | Fields w/ Caveats (⚠️) | Fields Unavailable (❌) | Fields Unknown (❓) | Total | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|-------|
| API Domains (1.x) | 4/5 | 0/5 | 1/5 | 5 | Schedules, routes, booking, SI available via EDI/portal; API unverified |
| Cutoffs (2.x) | 3/6 | 0/6 | 3/6 | 6 | DCO, VCO, FCO likely from portal "deadlines" feature |
| Container Milestones (3.x) | 7/9 | 0/9 | 2/9 | 9 | Core milestones confirmed by third-party trackers |
| Transport Events (4.x) | 4/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 | 4 | ETD/ETA confirmed on eCommerce platform |
| Change Detection (5.x) | 2/6 | 0/6 | 4/6 | 6 | Polling and classifier progression expected per DCSA |
| **Total** | **20/30** | **0/30** | **10/30** | **30** | **0% confirmed, 67% likely, 33% unknown** |

> **Important caveat**: No fields could be marked as fully confirmed (green checkmark) because ONE's developer portal is SPA-rendered and API documentation could not be reviewed without registration. The 20 "caveat" fields (67%) reflect capabilities that are expected to exist based on strong indirect evidence: DCSA founding membership with confirmed TNT implementation, comprehensive EDI support covering the same functional areas, eCommerce platform features showing the data, and third-party tracker milestone coverage. The 10 "unknown" fields (33%) lack even indirect evidence. Zero fields were assessed as unavailable, which is consistent with ONE's position as a major DCSA carrier. To convert caveats to confirmed availability, registration on the developer portal is required.

## Data Quality & Operational Notes

| Aspect | Assessment | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Event freshness** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **API uptime/reliability** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Historical data depth** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Timezone handling** | Unknown (UTC expected if DCSA-compliant) | Unknown |
| **Character encoding** | Unknown | Unknown |

### Known Issues & Gotchas

- Developer portal at developers.one-line.com is SPA-rendered (JavaScript-heavy single-page application), making it impossible to review API documentation without registration and browser access
- ONE was formed from three Japanese carriers (NYK, MOL, K Line) — legacy system integration may affect data consistency for older shipments or during transition periods
- THE Alliance services (shared vessel slots with Hapag-Lloyd, HMM, Yang Ming) may complicate tracking when ONE containers are on alliance partner vessels

### Recently Deprecated or Changed

- No deprecation notices identified from public sources

## SDK Adapter Recommendations

### Feasibility Assessment

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Can we build a useful adapter?** | **Yes (likely)** — ONE is a DCSA founding member with a confirmed TNT implementation and a developer portal. However, feasibility cannot be fully confirmed until the developer portal is accessed |
| **Implementation effort** | Low to Medium (estimated) — if ONE implements standard DCSA APIs, a DCSA base adapter with thin configuration layer should work. Cannot confirm until API docs are reviewed |
| **DCSA base adapter usable?** | Yes (expected) — ONE's DCSA TNT implementation should be compatible with a shared DCSA adapter. Deviations unknown |

### Recommended Approach

ONE should be approachable as a DCSA-compliant carrier, similar to the approach used for Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd, and Evergreen. The first step is to register on the developer portal at developers.one-line.com and review the full API catalog to determine exactly which DCSA APIs are implemented and at what versions.

If ONE implements DCSA TNT v2.2 (as is likely based on the timeline of other carrier implementations), the SDK adapter can extend the shared DCSA base adapter class with ONE-specific configuration (base URL, authentication, any DCSA deviations). If they have upgraded to TNT v3, even better — fewer deviations from the latest standard are expected.

As a fallback or complement, integration through aggregators (project44, Vizion, or INTTRA) should be evaluated. These aggregators already provide ONE tracking data and may offer a faster path to integration if the direct API proves difficult to access or has limitations.

### Recommended Lookup Method

Bill of Lading (B/L) number or Container number — both confirmed as supported through the eCommerce platform. B/L number provides shipment-level context (all containers on a shipment), while container number provides granular per-container tracking. The DCSA TNT standard supports both.

### Recommended Polling Strategy

| Detail | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Polling interval** | Every 2-4 hours (estimated — cannot determine optimal interval without knowing rate limits and data freshness) |
| **Incremental filter** | Use `eventCreatedDateTime > lastPollTime` if DCSA TNT is implemented (mandatory per DCSA spec) |
| **Batch tracking** | Unknown — DCSA TNT typically supports one shipment per query. Batch capability unknown |

### Auth Implementation Notes

Authentication mechanism is unknown. The developer portal has a dedicated API Auth page, suggesting non-trivial auth (likely OAuth2 or JWT based on industry patterns). SSL will need to register on the portal to determine the exact flow. Given that other DCSA carriers use OAuth2 (Maersk, CMA CGM) or JWT (Evergreen), one of these is the most likely mechanism.

### Edge Cases to Handle

- THE Alliance vessel sharing: ONE containers may be on Hapag-Lloyd, HMM, or Yang Ming vessels. Tracking events should still flow through ONE's API for ONE bookings, but vessel details may reference partner vessels
- Legacy carrier transition: ONE was formed from NYK, MOL, and K Line in 2018. Very old bookings or references from pre-2018 may use legacy SCAC codes
- Multi-carrier transshipment: Transshipment events at alliance hub ports may involve containers being handled across multiple alliance partners

### Mapping Complexity

If ONE implements standard DCSA TNT, mapping complexity should be **low** — the DCSA event model maps directly to the canonical data model defined in `docs/required-data-fields.md`. The primary mapping concern would be identifying which DCSA version is in use (v2.2 vs v3) as there are structural differences between versions (single `/events` endpoint in v2.2 vs separate event type endpoints in v3, presence/absence of `isTransshipmentMove` field, etc.).
