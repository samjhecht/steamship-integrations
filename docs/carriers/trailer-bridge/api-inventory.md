### Access Requirements Summary for SSL

Trailer Bridge does not offer a public API or developer portal. The only programmatic access paths are:

1. **Web portal scraping**: The QuickTrack portal (https://quicktrack.trailerbridge.com/) allows tracking by booking number, equipment number, or VIN without login. This could potentially be scraped, subject to ToS review.

2. **Customer portal**: A registered customer portal exists at transit.trailerbridge.com with login-protected access, which may expose additional data.

3. **Third-party aggregators**: ShipsGo provides Trailer Bridge tracking via their platform. Vizion and project44 do not appear to support Trailer Bridge.

4. **Direct partnership**: SSL could contact Trailer Bridge directly to negotiate data sharing or EDI connectivity. Given Trailer Bridge's use of Mastery Logistics MasterMind TMS, there may be integration options through that platform.

> **Notes on Coverage:**
> - Trailer Bridge has no public API whatsoever. All "partial" ratings reflect data that may be visible on the QuickTrack web portal but is not accessible programmatically.
> - The QuickTrack portal (https://quicktrack.trailerbridge.com/) supports lookup by booking number, equipment number, or VIN and provides shipment status updates without login.
> - The customer portal at transit.trailerbridge.com may expose additional data behind authentication.
> - Third-party aggregators like ShipsGo provide tracking for Trailer Bridge shipments, likely via web scraping, and offer their own API access to that data.
> - Trailer Bridge operates primarily direct services (Jacksonville to San Juan, Dominican Republic, USVI) with minimal transshipment, so transshipment-related fields (3.5, 3.6, 4.3, 4.4) are operationally less relevant.

## Non-API Access Methods

### Web Portal Tracking

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Tracking URL** | https://quicktrack.trailerbridge.com/ |
| **Login required?** | No -- QuickTrack allows tracking without a User ID |
| **Data available on portal but NOT in API** | All data is portal-only. QuickTrack provides shipment status by booking number, equipment number, or VIN. Customer portal at transit.trailerbridge.com likely has additional detail behind login |
| **Scraping feasibility** | Potentially feasible -- no login required for QuickTrack. Anti-bot measures and ToS not assessed. ShipsGo and other third-party trackers appear to successfully aggregate Trailer Bridge tracking data, suggesting scraping is viable |

### EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **EDI supported?** | Unknown |
| **EDI message types** | Unknown |
| **EDI connection method** | Unknown |
| **EDI documentation** | Unknown -- contact carrier directly |

### Third-Party Aggregators

| Aggregator | Carrier Available? | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **project44** | No | Not listed in project44's supported ocean carrier SCAC list |
| **FourKites** | Unknown | No confirmation found |
| **Vizion** | No | Not listed in Vizion's supported carriers list |
| **INTTRA / E2open** | Unknown | No confirmed partnership |
| **CargoSmart** | Unknown | No confirmation found |
| **ShipsGo** | Yes | ShipsGo provides Trailer Bridge container tracking via their platform and API. Supports B/L, booking, and container number lookup |
| **Terminal49** | Unknown | Terminal49 offers multi-carrier tracking API but Trailer Bridge support not confirmed |

> **Aggregator note:** Trailer Bridge is a small regional carrier not covered by major aggregators like project44 or Vizion. ShipsGo appears to be the most viable aggregator option, likely obtaining data via web scraping of the QuickTrack portal. For programmatic tracking, ShipsGo's API may be the path of least resistance compared to building a custom scraper.

| **Event freshness** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **API uptime/reliability** | N/A -- no API | N/A |
| **Historical data depth** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Timezone handling** | Unknown -- likely US Eastern (Jacksonville HQ) or Atlantic (San Juan) | Estimated |
| **Character encoding** | Unknown | Unknown |

### Known Issues & Gotchas

- **No API at all**: Trailer Bridge is a small regional carrier with no public API, no developer portal, and no published EDI documentation. All digital integration must go through web scraping, third-party aggregators, or direct partnership negotiation.

- **Jones Act carrier**: Trailer Bridge is one of only three Jones Act carriers serving Puerto Rico from Jacksonville (alongside Crowley and TOTE Maritime). Jones Act compliance means US-built, US-flagged, US-crewed vessels. This is relevant for understanding the carrier's regulatory context but does not affect API integration.

- **Integrated truck-barge model**: Trailer Bridge operates an unusual integrated truck-and-barge system rather than traditional container vessels. This means their shipment tracking may use different event concepts than standard container shipping (e.g., barge loading vs. vessel loading).

- **VIN tracking**: QuickTrack supports tracking by Vehicle Identification Number (last 8 digits), reflecting the carrier's significant RoRo/vehicle shipping business. This is unusual for ocean carriers and may indicate a tracking data model oriented around vehicles rather than containers.

- **MasterMind TMS**: Trailer Bridge adopted Mastery Logistics Systems' MasterMind TMS in 2022, with plans to extend it to ocean operations. This modern TMS platform could eventually expose integration points, but no public-facing API has been announced.

- **Logistics division sold**: In October 2025, Trailer Bridge announced the sale of its logistics division to ATS. This may affect the scope of services and technology investments going forward. The ocean shipping operations appear to be retained.

### Recently Deprecated or Changed

- No deprecation notices found (no API to deprecate). The logistics division sale to ATS (October 2025) may restructure the company's technology footprint.

## SDK Adapter Recommendations

### Feasibility Assessment

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Can we build a useful adapter?** | No -- not via direct API. Partial via web scraping or ShipsGo aggregator |
| **Implementation effort** | Very High (no API) -- would require web scraping or aggregator integration |
| **DCSA base adapter usable?** | No -- no API exists, let alone a DCSA-compliant one |

### Recommended Approach

Trailer Bridge cannot be integrated via a direct API adapter because no API exists. There are three possible approaches, listed in order of preference:

1. **ShipsGo aggregator integration**: ShipsGo provides Trailer Bridge tracking data via their own API. Building a ShipsGo adapter that covers Trailer Bridge (and potentially other small carriers) would be the most maintainable approach. The trade-off is dependency on a third-party aggregator and whatever data ShipsGo can extract.

2. **Web scraping adapter**: Build a scraper targeting QuickTrack (https://quicktrack.trailerbridge.com/) to extract tracking status by booking or equipment number. This is fragile (UI changes break the scraper) and may violate Trailer Bridge's Terms of Service. Not recommended for production use.

3. **Direct partnership/EDI**: Contact Trailer Bridge to negotiate EDI connectivity or a data feed. Given their adoption of MasterMind TMS (a modern cloud platform), there may be integration possibilities not publicly documented. This requires business development effort.

Given Trailer Bridge's niche market (US-Caribbean, primarily Puerto Rico), the volume of SSL shipments through this carrier should determine the investment level. For low volume, manual tracking via the QuickTrack portal may be sufficient.

### Recommended Lookup Method

**Booking number** is the recommended primary lookup, as it is one of the three fields supported by QuickTrack and is the most universal identifier in the booking workflow.

**Equipment (container) number** as secondary -- also supported by QuickTrack.

### Recommended Polling Strategy

| Detail | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Polling interval** | N/A -- no API to poll. If using ShipsGo, follow their recommended polling interval |
| **Incremental filter** | N/A |
| **Batch tracking** | N/A |

### Auth Implementation Notes

No authentication implementation needed -- there is no API. If integrating via ShipsGo, follow ShipsGo's auth requirements.

### Edge Cases to Handle

- **Barge vs. vessel**: Trailer Bridge uses barges rather than traditional container ships. Event terminology and tracking milestones may differ from standard container shipping.
- **VIN-based tracking**: The carrier's RoRo business uses VIN-based tracking, which has no DCSA equivalent and would need special handling.
- **Limited route network**: Only a handful of routes (JAX-SJU, JAX-DR, JAX-USVI), so transshipment events are essentially non-existent.
- **Logistics division sale**: The 2025 sale of the logistics division to ATS may change the carrier's technology stack and integration capabilities.

### Mapping Complexity

**N/A -- no data to map.** There is no API response to transform into the canonical data model. If data is obtained via ShipsGo or web scraping, the mapping complexity depends on the data source's response format rather than Trailer Bridge's own systems.
