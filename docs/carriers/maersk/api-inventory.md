## Digital Ecosystem & Developer Experience

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Has developer portal?** | Yes |
| **Developer portal URL** | https://developer.maersk.com |
| **API documentation URL(s)** | https://developer.maersk.com (SPA — API catalogue requires JavaScript rendering) |
| **Documentation quality** | Excellent — comprehensive DCSA-aligned docs with interactive API references (reported by developers; portal requires registration for full access) |
| **OpenAPI/Swagger spec available?** | Yes — via DCSA standard specs at https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI and interactive docs on developer portal (Scalar-based API reference viewer detected in portal source) |
| **Sandbox/test environment?** | Yes — Maersk provides a sandbox/test environment via the developer portal (reported; details require portal registration) |
| **Developer registration** | Free self-service registration at https://developer.maersk.com — no partner agreement required for API access |
| **Developer support channels** | Developer portal support, Maersk API support team (via portal), status page at https://status.maersk.com |
| **Community/third-party libraries** | Minimal — no significant open-source client libraries found on GitHub, npm, or PyPI. A few individual repos exist (e.g., `srushtikanade-pixel/maersk-tracking`) but none are maintained or substantial |
| **API changelog / release notes** | Available on developer portal (requires login); DCSA spec changelogs at https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI |

## Standards Compliance

### DCSA (Digital Container Shipping Association)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **DCSA member?** | Yes — founding member of DCSA |
| **DCSA APIs implemented** | TNT (Track & Trace), BKG (Booking), CS (Commercial Schedules) |
| **DCSA TNT version** | v2 and v3 (both confirmed live — `/synergy/tracking/v2/events` and `/track-and-trace/v3/events`). **Note:** The GitHub master branch (`tnt/v3/tnt.yaml`) contains TNT v3.0.0-Beta-1 (March 2023). A redesigned TNT 3.0.0 is published on SwaggerHub but remains in alpha/design iterations (20250912-design, 20251121-alpha, 20260116-alpha). Maersk's live `/track-and-trace/v3/` endpoints align with the **Beta-1** design pattern (subscription endpoints, event filtering), not the redesigned 3.0.0 architecture. |
| **DCSA Booking version** | v2.x (booking endpoints exist but exact Maersk path not confirmed as 404 at `/booking/v2/bookings` — likely behind a different path prefix) |
| **DCSA Schedules version** | v1.x (`/schedules/v1/vessel-schedules`, `/schedules/v1/port-schedules`, `/schedules/v1/point-to-point-routes` all confirmed live) |
| **Known DCSA deviations** | None documented publicly. As a DCSA founding member, Maersk is among the most complete DCSA implementors. Minor deviations may exist between DCSA spec versions — Maersk appears to run both v2 and v3 TNT endpoints simultaneously. Some endpoints use different path prefixes than the DCSA spec paths (e.g., `/synergy/tracking/v2/` vs. spec's `/v2/events`) |

### Other Standards

| Standard | Supported? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **UN/EDIFACT (EDI)** | Yes | Maersk supports IFTMIN, IFTSTA, COPARN, BAPLIE and other EDIFACT message types for traditional B2B communication |
| **INTTRA integration** | Yes | Maersk is available on the INTTRA (now E2open) platform for booking and tracking |
| **BIC (Bureau International des Containers)** | Yes | Standard container ID format (owner code + serial + check digit) used throughout APIs |
| **UN/LOCODE** | Yes | UNLocationCode used consistently across all endpoints (confirmed in DCSA spec implementations) |

---

## Authentication & Access

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Auth mechanism** | Dual: OAuth2 Client Credentials (for some endpoints) + API Key (Consumer-Key header, for others) |
| **Auth documentation** | https://developer.maersk.com (authentication section — requires login for full details) |
| **Registration process** | 1. Visit https://developer.maersk.com 2. Create a free developer account 3. Register an application to obtain API key / client credentials 4. Use credentials to authenticate API calls |
| **Registration URL** | https://developer.maersk.com |
| **Partner program required?** | No — basic API access is self-service. Production / elevated access may require a business relationship for some APIs |
| **Partner program URL** | N/A for basic access |
| **Credential type** | Consumer-Key (API Key) for most endpoints; Client ID + Client Secret for OAuth2 endpoints |
| **Token refresh supported?** | Yes — OAuth2 client_credentials flow provides access tokens; refresh by re-requesting |
| **Token lifetime** | Unknown — requires live testing to determine (estimated ~1 hour based on standard OAuth2 patterns) |
| **Access tiers** | Reported: Basic (self-service, standard rate limits) and Partner/Enterprise (elevated limits). Specific tier details require portal registration to confirm |
| **IP whitelisting required?** | No — CORS headers indicate `access-control-allow-origin: *` (wide open) |

### Authentication Details Observed

Two distinct auth patterns were observed during endpoint probing:

1. **OAuth2 pattern** — Endpoints under `/synergy/tracking/v2/`, `/v1/inland/`, `/v1/locations`, `/v1/products/` return: `{"httpMethod":"GET","requestUri":"...","statusCode":401,"statusText":"Unauthorized","correlationIdentifier":"...","errorTimestamp":"..."}`. These use OAuth2 Bearer tokens obtained from `POST api.maersk.com/oauth2/access_token` with `grant_type=client_credentials`.

2. **API Key pattern** — Endpoints under `/track-and-trace/v3/`, `/schedules/v1/`, `/rates/`, `/ecommerce/tracking/`, `/products/v1/`, `/reference-data/v1/` return: `{"error":[{"code":"ERR_GW_001","message":"API Key Validation Failed, please check the API key","reason":"Invalid or expired Key","status":"401"}]}`. These require a `Consumer-Key` header (observed in CORS `access-control-allow-headers`).

The `access-control-allow-headers` response lists both `Authorization` and `Consumer-Key` / `x-maersk-consumer-key`, confirming the dual auth approach.

### Access Requirements Summary for SSL

Maersk offers the most developer-friendly API access of any major ocean carrier. SSL can get started immediately by:

1. Registering a free developer account at https://developer.maersk.com (self-service, no business relationship needed)
2. Creating an application to obtain a Consumer-Key (API key) and/or OAuth2 client credentials
3. Using the sandbox environment for development and testing

For production usage with higher rate limits or access to additional APIs (e.g., Booking, Spot Rates), SSL may need to engage with Maersk's partnership team. The basic tracking and scheduling APIs should be accessible with self-service credentials.

## Rate Limits & Quotas

| Detail | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Global rate limit** | Unpublished — not discoverable without authenticated access | Unknown |
| **Per-endpoint limits** | Unpublished — reported to vary by API product and access tier | Unknown |
| **Daily/monthly quota** | Unpublished | Unknown |
| **Rate limit response** | Expected: 429 with Retry-After header (per DCSA and REST conventions) | Estimated (unverified) |
| **Rate limit by** | Consumer-Key / OAuth token (inferred from auth patterns — each client gets its own limits) | Estimated (unverified) |
| **Burst allowance** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Different tiers** | Reported: free/self-service tier has lower limits; partner tier has higher limits. Specific numbers require portal registration to confirm | Reported (developer community — could not verify source URL) |

> **Note:** Maersk runs on Apigee (inferred from proxy error message format `"faultstring":"Unable to identify proxy for host: maersk-host"`) with Akamai CDN fronting. Rate limiting is likely implemented at the API gateway level. Specific limits will be visible in the developer portal after registration.

---

## Webhook / Push Support

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Webhooks supported?** | Yes — Maersk implements the optional DCSA TNT v3 subscription/push model |
| **Subscription endpoint** | `POST /track-and-trace/v3/event-subscriptions` (v3) and `POST /synergy/tracking/v2/subscriptions` (v2, likely legacy) |
| **Subscription management** | Full CRUD: Create (POST), List (GET), Get by ID (GET), Update (PUT), Delete (DELETE), Rotate secret (PUT /secret) |
| **Subscribable event types** | All DCSA event types: SHIPMENT, TRANSPORT, EQUIPMENT. Filterable by: `eventTypes`, `shipmentEventTypeCodes`, `transportEventTypeCodes`, `equipmentEventTypeCodes`, `documentTypeCodes`, `documentReference`, `equipmentReference`, `vesselIMONumber`, `carrierServiceCode`, `UNLocationCode` |
| **Callback format** | DCSA event JSON POSTed to `callbackUrl` specified in subscription |
| **Callback authentication** | Shared secret — set during subscription creation, rotatable via dedicated endpoint |
| **Retry policy on failure** | Unknown — DCSA spec does not mandate specific retry policy. Likely carrier-specific implementation |
| **Documented reliability** | Unknown — no published SLA for webhook delivery. Polling is the reliable fallback |

---

## Non-API Access Methods

### Web Portal Tracking

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Tracking URL** | https://www.maersk.com/tracking |
| **Login required?** | No — basic tracking by B/L or container number is available without login. Detailed views may require a Maersk account |
| **Data available on portal but NOT in API** | Unlikely — Maersk's API surface is comprehensive. Portal may have richer visualization but the underlying data should be accessible via APIs |
| **Scraping feasibility** | Not needed — API coverage is excellent. Portal is SPA-based (would require headless browser if scraping were needed) |

### EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **EDI supported?** | Yes |
| **EDI message types** | IFTMIN (Booking), IFTSTA (Status), COPARN (Container release/acceptance), BAPLIE (Bay plan), CUSCAR (Customs cargo), CUSREP (Customs report) |
| **EDI connection method** | AS2, SFTP — via Maersk's EDI team |
| **EDI documentation** | Contact Maersk directly; not publicly documented on developer portal (EDI is legacy/enterprise channel) |

### Third-Party Aggregators

| Aggregator | Carrier Available? | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **project44** | Yes | Maersk is a major carrier in project44's ocean visibility network |
| **FourKites** | Yes | Maersk coverage available through FourKites ocean tracking |
| **Vizion** | Yes | Maersk is available through Vizion's carrier API aggregation (Vizion provides normalized access to carrier tracking) |
| **INTTRA / E2open** | Yes | Maersk is a founding carrier on the INTTRA platform (now E2open Ocean); supports booking and tracking |
| **CargoSmart** | Yes | Maersk is available on CargoSmart for tracking and schedule visibility |

> **Aggregator note:** Given Maersk's excellent direct API coverage, there is minimal benefit to accessing Maersk through a third-party aggregator for SSL's use case. Direct API integration provides richer data (full DCSA event model, webhooks, cutoffs) than most aggregators expose. Aggregators may be useful as a fallback or for cross-carrier normalization if SSL wants a single integration point.

## Data Quality & Operational Notes

| Aspect | Assessment | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Event freshness** | Reported as ~5–15 minutes for most equipment events; transport events (ETD/ETA) may update less frequently based on vessel reporting | Reported (developer forums — no specific URL verifiable) |
| **API uptime/reliability** | Maersk has a published status page (https://status.maersk.com) indicating enterprise-grade reliability. No SLA numbers publicly available | Official (status page exists) |
| **Historical data depth** | Unknown — DCSA spec does not mandate a minimum retention period. Estimated ~90–180 days based on industry norms | Estimated ~90–180 days (unverified) |
| **Timezone handling** | ISO 8601 with timezone offset (e.g., `2022-09-19T06:31:00+02:00`) per DCSA specification | Official (DCSA spec) |
| **Character encoding** | UTF-8 per DCSA specification | Official (DCSA spec) |

### Known Issues & Gotchas

- **Dual auth mechanism**: Some endpoints use OAuth2 Bearer tokens, others use API Key (Consumer-Key header). The SDK adapter needs to support both and know which to use per endpoint. This may indicate API evolution (older endpoints use OAuth2, newer ones use API Key) or different API products with different auth requirements.

- **Multiple tracking endpoint versions**: Both v2 (`/synergy/tracking/v2/events`) and v3 (`/track-and-trace/v3/events`) appear to be live simultaneously. The v3 endpoint should be preferred (aligns with latest DCSA TNT spec), but v2 may offer features not yet available in v3 or may be needed as fallback.

- **Path prefix variations**: Maersk doesn't use bare DCSA paths (e.g., `/v3/events`). Instead, paths have Maersk-specific prefixes (`/track-and-trace/v3/events`, `/synergy/tracking/v2/events`, `/schedules/v1/vessel-schedules`). This means DCSA OpenAPI specs can't be used directly — paths need carrier-specific mapping.

- **eCommerce tracking vs. standard tracking**: The `/ecommerce/tracking/` endpoint appears separate from `/track-and-trace/`. These may return different response shapes or serve different use cases (simplified e-commerce view vs. full DCSA event model). Needs live testing to confirm.

- **Booking endpoint path unknown**: The standard DCSA BKG path (`/booking/v2/bookings`) returned 404. The booking API exists (Maersk's developer portal lists it) but likely uses a different path prefix. This will be discoverable upon portal registration.

- **2M alliance dissolution**: The 2M alliance with MSC ended in January 2025. Maersk now operates the Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd. This may affect vessel sharing, transshipment patterns, and schedule data. Ensure alliance context is not hard-coded.

- **Akamai bot protection**: Maersk's API gateway is fronted by Akamai (confirmed from response headers). Unusual request patterns may trigger bot detection. SDK should use standard User-Agent headers and reasonable request rates.

### Recently Deprecated or Changed

- **TNT v2 → v3 transition**: The `/synergy/tracking/v2/` endpoints may be deprecated in favor of `/track-and-trace/v3/`. Both are currently live, but new integrations should target v3.

- **2M alliance ended January 2025**: Maersk vessel-sharing arrangements with MSC are no longer active. New Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd affects routing and scheduling.

## SDK Adapter Recommendations

### Feasibility Assessment

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Can we build a useful adapter?** | Yes — Maersk has the most comprehensive API surface of any ocean carrier. Full tracking, schedules, cutoffs, webhooks, and even rates are available |
| **Implementation effort** | Low (DCSA passthrough with path mapping) — Maersk implements DCSA standards; mapping is straightforward. Minor complexity from dual auth and path prefixes |
| **DCSA base adapter usable?** | Yes — Maersk is among the most complete DCSA implementors. A shared DCSA base adapter can handle 90%+ of the logic; Maersk adapter adds path prefix mapping and auth handling |

### Recommended Approach

The Maersk adapter should be built as the **first implementation** for the DCSA base adapter class, given Maersk's comprehensive DCSA compliance. Since Maersk follows DCSA standards closely, the adapter architecture should be:

1. **DCSA Base Adapter**: Handles event parsing, normalization to canonical model, pagination traversal, subscription management, and event classifier progression logic. This base class is reusable across all DCSA-compliant carriers.

2. **Maersk Adapter** (extends DCSA Base): Provides Maersk-specific configuration: API base URL (`api.maersk.com`), path prefix mapping (e.g., DCSA `/v3/events` → Maersk `/track-and-trace/v3/events`), dual auth handling (OAuth2 for legacy endpoints, API Key for newer endpoints), and any Maersk-specific response quirks.

3. **Auth Handler**: Implement both OAuth2 client_credentials flow (for `/synergy/` and `/v1/` endpoints) and API Key injection (Consumer-Key header for `/track-and-trace/` and `/schedules/` endpoints). Token caching and refresh for OAuth2.

Build Maersk first, extract the DCSA base class from it, then implement other DCSA-compliant carriers (MSC, Hapag-Lloyd, ONE) as thin configuration layers on top of the same base.

### Recommended Lookup Method

**Bill of Lading (B/L) number** is the recommended primary lookup method:
- Universally assigned after booking confirmation
- Works across all tracking endpoints
- Returns the richest event data (all container milestones, transport events, and shipment events linked to the B/L)
- Maersk DCSA mapping: `documentTypeCodes=TRD&documentReference={blNumber}`

**Booking reference** as secondary:
- Available earlier in the lifecycle (before B/L issuance)
- Use `documentTypeCodes=BKG&documentReference={bookingRef}`
- Good for pre-shipment tracking (cutoffs, booking status)

**Container number** as supplementary:
- Use `equipmentReference={containerNumber}` for per-container tracking
- Useful for multi-container shipments where individual container progress differs

### Recommended Polling Strategy

| Detail | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Polling interval** | Every 2–4 hours for active shipments; every 12–24 hours for pre-departure shipments. More frequent polling (~30 min) for shipments near critical milestones (approaching cutoffs, near arrival) |
| **Incremental filter** | Use `eventCreatedDateTime:gte={lastPollTimestamp}` to fetch only new events since last poll. This is mandatory per DCSA spec and highly efficient |
| **Batch tracking** | One API call per shipment (DCSA events API filters by document reference). No batch/multi-shipment endpoint in the standard. For efficiency, use webhooks for real-time updates and poll as verification/fallback |

### Auth Implementation Notes

```
OAuth2 Flow (for /synergy/ and /v1/ endpoints):
  POST https://api.maersk.com/oauth2/access_token
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Body: grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={id}&client_secret={secret}
  Response: {"access_token":"...","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":3600}
  Usage: Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

API Key Flow (for /track-and-trace/ and /schedules/ endpoints):
  Header: Consumer-Key: {api_key}
  (Or possibly: x-maersk-consumer-key: {api_key})
```

The adapter should:
- Cache OAuth2 tokens and refresh before expiry (subtract ~60s safety margin)
- Support both auth methods and route to the correct one based on endpoint path
- Store credentials securely (provided by consumer, never logged)
- Handle 401 responses by refreshing auth and retrying once

### Edge Cases to Handle

- **Transshipment events may arrive out of order**: Container DISC at transshipment port may be recorded before vessel ARRI at that port if carrier systems have different update timings. Sort by `eventDateTime`, not `eventCreatedDateTime`.

- **Multiple containers per booking**: A single booking may have multiple containers, each with independent milestone progressions. The SDK should track per-container state while providing a booking-level summary.

- **Rolled containers**: If a container misses a vessel cutoff, it appears as a re-scheduling — new PLN events replace previous estimates. Watch for `retractedEventID` in metadata.

- **Vessel changes (blank sailings)**: Carriers may cancel port calls or change vessels. Transport events for the cancelled call will have `retractedEventID` pointing to the original event. New events will appear for the replacement vessel/schedule.

- **Alliance transition events**: During the 2M → Gemini Cooperation transition, some historical shipments may show MSC vessels/events, while new shipments show Hapag-Lloyd cooperation patterns. Don't hard-code alliance assumptions.

- **E-commerce tracking endpoint divergence**: The `/ecommerce/tracking/` endpoint may return a simplified response schema compared to the full DCSA `/track-and-trace/` endpoint. Test both and prefer the DCSA endpoint for richness.

### Mapping Complexity

**Low complexity.** Maersk's DCSA compliance means the response format closely matches the canonical data model defined in `docs/required-data-fields.md`. Key mapping tasks:

1. **Path prefix mapping**: DCSA spec paths → Maersk-specific paths (simple configuration, not logic)
2. **Auth routing**: Determine which auth method to use per endpoint (configurable rule)
3. **Event normalization**: Already DCSA-compliant — mostly passthrough. Extract `equipmentEventTypeCode` + `emptyIndicatorCode` + `isTransshipmentMove` combination to map to canonical milestones
4. **Cutoff extraction**: Pull `shipmentCutOffTimes[]` from booking response and map `cutOffDateTimeCode` to canonical cutoff fields
5. **Timestamp normalization**: Already ISO 8601 with timezone — minimal transformation needed

The only non-trivial mapping is combining multiple DCSA event fields into our composite canonical milestones (e.g., `LOAD` + `LADEN` + `isTransshipmentMove: false` → "Container Loaded on Vessel").
