## Digital Ecosystem & Developer Experience

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Has developer portal?** | Yes |
| **Developer portal URL** | [https://developerportal.msc.com/](https://developerportal.msc.com/) |
| **API documentation URL(s)** | [API Catalogue](https://developerportal.msc.com/api-catalogue), [Subscription Guidelines](https://developerportal.msc.com/subscription), [EDI Guidelines](https://developerportal.msc.com/edi-guideline) |
| **Documentation quality** | Fair — Developer portal is publicly accessible with sandbox and "Try it Out" functionality, but API catalogue content loads dynamically via embedded iframes making offline review difficult. Production API details require onboarding. No public OpenAPI spec file found. |
| **OpenAPI/Swagger spec available?** | Sandbox Swagger appears to be available within the developer portal's API Catalogue (embedded), but no standalone downloadable OpenAPI spec file was found publicly. MSC's APIs follow DCSA TNT v2.2, so the [DCSA OpenAPI spec](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_TNT/2.2.0) serves as the reference. |
| **Sandbox/test environment?** | Yes — the developer portal provides a sandbox with predefined production-like mock data. "Try it Out" functionality available directly in the API Catalogue. |
| **Developer registration** | Requires formal request — submit the [Direct Integration Request Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=AJuOCND_jkW_oaz0xZbTy3IqSmARn5lCgJs0UnRRCHtUN1laQ1NNQUFNU0tNMkxJNFdWOVoxQ1c0Vy4u) for production access. Sandbox appears publicly accessible. |
| **Developer support channels** | MSC provides 24/7 support for direct integrations. Contact via the Direct Integration Request Form or local MSC representatives. |
| **Community/third-party libraries** | None found — no MSC-specific client libraries on GitHub or npm. DCSA reference implementations available at [github.com/dcsaorg](https://github.com/dcsaorg). |
| **API changelog / release notes** | Not published as a standalone changelog. Updates noted on developer portal pages (e.g., subscription and EDI guideline pages include date annotations). |

### Access Requirements Summary for SSL

MSC does **not** offer self-service API registration. To get production API access, SSL must submit the Direct Integration Request Form and go through MSC's onboarding process. This involves contact with MSC's digital solutions team, defining integration scope, receiving API definitions and sandbox access, testing, and then production credential issuance.

**Key considerations:**
- Fees may apply for both setup and ongoing maintenance
- The sandbox with mock data is available through the developer portal for initial evaluation
- SSL should indicate they are interested in Track and Trace API access and Commercial Schedules
- If SSL has an existing MSC business relationship (which they likely do as an NVOCC), this should be mentioned in the request
- Former RSS Feed (web services) customers should mention their current URL for migration assistance

## Rate Limits & Quotas

| Detail | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Global rate limit** | Unpublished | Unknown |
| **Per-endpoint limits** | Unpublished | Unknown |
| **Daily/monthly quota** | Unpublished | Unknown |
| **Rate limit response** | Unknown — likely 429 with Retry-After header per DCSA standard practice | Estimated (unverified) |
| **Rate limit by** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Burst allowance** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Different tiers** | Likely — MSC mentions "Depending on your requirements, setup and maintenance fees may apply" suggesting tiered access | Reported (from MSC FAQ) |

> **Note**: Rate limit details are not publicly documented. They are likely communicated during the onboarding process and may vary by customer agreement.

---

## Webhook / Push Support

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Webhooks supported?** | Yes — via **Azure Service Bus** (not standard REST webhooks) |
| **Subscription endpoint** | `POST /v2/event-subscriptions` (DCSA standard) |
| **Subscription management** | Create/list/get/update/delete via DCSA subscription API endpoints |
| **Subscribable event types** | SHIPMENT, TRANSPORT, EQUIPMENT events — filterable by booking ref, B/L, container number |
| **Callback format** | Azure Service Bus messages containing DCSA event JSON. **Not standard HTTP POST to callbackUrl** — MSC uses Azure Service Bus as the delivery mechanism. |
| **Callback authentication** | Subscription secret (resettable via `PUT /v2/event-subscriptions/{id}/secret`) + Azure Service Bus connection credentials |
| **Retry policy on failure** | Unknown — Azure Service Bus has built-in message retry/dead-letter capabilities |

> **Critical note for SDK implementation**: MSC's push notification system uses Azure Service Bus, not standard HTTP webhook callbacks. This means the SDK's subscription consumer would need an Azure Service Bus client library rather than a simple HTTP server. This is a significant architectural consideration.

---

## Non-API Access Methods

### Web Portal Tracking

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Tracking URL** | [https://www.msc.com/en/track-a-shipment](https://www.msc.com/en/track-a-shipment) |
| **Login required?** | No login required for basic container tracking; myMSC login required for full shipment management |
| **myMSC platform** | [https://mymsc.com](https://mymsc.com) — full shipment management portal (booking, tracking, documents, quotes) |
| **Data available on portal but NOT in API** | Instant Quotes (rates), some document downloads, customer-specific reporting. Portal may also show more human-readable descriptions. |
| **Scraping feasibility** | Difficult — MSC's website uses Akamai CDN with aggressive bot protection (all automated requests return 403). |

### EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **EDI supported?** | Yes — comprehensive EDI support, MSC's longest-running integration method (20+ years) |
| **EDI message types — EDIFACT** | IFTMBF (Booking Request), IFTMBC (Booking Confirmation), IFTMIN (Shipping Instruction), VERMAS (VGM), IFTMCS (Bill of Lading), IFTSAI (Routing/Sailing), IFTSTA (Track and Trace), APERAK (Functional Acknowledge) |
| **EDI message types — ANSI X12** | 300 (Booking Request), 301 (Booking Confirmation), 315 (Track and Trace), 323 (Routing/Sailing) |
| **EDI connection method** | SFTP, AS2 (confirmed on MSC Direct Integrations page) |
| **EDI documentation** | [EDI Guidelines on Developer Portal](https://developerportal.msc.com/edi-guideline) — implementation guidelines for each message type |

### Third-Party Aggregators

| Aggregator | Carrier Available? | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **project44** | Yes (likely) | MSC is the 2nd largest carrier globally; project44 covers all major carriers. Not explicitly confirmed from MSC's pages but near-certain given market position. |
| **FourKites** | Yes (likely) | Same reasoning as project44 — FourKites covers major ocean carriers. |
| **Vizion** | Yes (likely) | Vizion states they "standardize messages across all carriers" and covers major ocean lines. |
| **INTTRA / E2open** | ✅ Yes | **Confirmed** on MSC Direct Integrations page as a connection partner. |
| **CargoSmart** | ✅ Yes | **Confirmed** on MSC Direct Integrations page as a connection partner. |
| **InforNexus** | ✅ Yes | **Confirmed** on MSC Direct Integrations page as a connection partner. |

> **Aggregator note**: MSC explicitly lists INTTRA, InforNexus, and CargoSmart as connection partners on their Direct Integrations page, stating they "design and tailor technology solutions" including "developing direct integration solutions" for these platforms. For SSL, using an aggregator may be simpler than direct MSC API onboarding if the aggregator relationship already exists.

## Data Quality & Operational Notes

| Aspect | Assessment | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Event freshness** | APIs support "near real-time" data exchange (MSC's wording). Actual latency unknown. | Reported (MSC Direct Integrations page) |
| **API uptime/reliability** | Unknown — no public SLA published. MSC offers 24/7 support for direct integrations. | Unknown |
| **Historical data depth** | Unknown — not documented publicly. | Unknown |
| **Timezone handling** | UTC (DCSA standard mandates ISO 8601 with UTC offset for all timestamps) | Official (DCSA TNT v2.2 specification) |
| **Character encoding** | UTF-8 (DCSA standard) | Official (DCSA specification) |

### Known Issues & Gotchas

- **No self-service API access**: Production credentials require formal onboarding through MSC's Direct Integration Request Form. This process involves MSC specialists and may include fees.
- **Azure Service Bus for push**: MSC uses Azure Service Bus instead of standard HTTP webhooks for event subscriptions. This requires Azure-specific client libraries for consuming push notifications.
- **Website blocks automation**: MSC's main website (www.msc.com) uses Akamai CDN with aggressive bot protection — all curl/automated requests return 403. This affects any web scraping fallback strategy.
- **Booking API status uncertain**: The DCSA Booking 2.0 API was listed as "planned for end of 2025" on the page captured Oct 2025. Its current status (Feb 2026) is unknown — it may now be live.
- **Internal codes**: MSC uses a mix of standard codes (SMDG, BIC) and internal codes. MSC states coded values will be explained during onboarding.
- **DCSA TNT v2.2 vs. v3.0**: MSC implements v2.2, not the latest v3.0. The event model differs between versions (v2 uses combined event types, v3 has separated Equipment, Transport, and Shipment event models). The SDK adapter must account for v2.2 specifics.
- **No public OpenAPI spec**: While the developer portal has embedded API documentation, no standalone downloadable OpenAPI/Swagger spec was found. The DCSA TNT v2.2 spec should serve as the reference.

### Recently Deprecated or Changed

- **TradeLens**: MSC previously participated in TradeLens (IBM/Maersk blockchain platform). TradeLens was shut down in 2023. MSC's page for it returned 404 by late 2023, then 301 redirect by 2024.
- **RSS Feed (Web Services)**: MSC's FAQ mentions "current RSS Feed (web services) customer" migration to the new API, suggesting an older RSS-based tracking service existed and is being sunset.
- **EDI Track & Trace 315**: The N9*CA reference identifier was replaced with N9*SCA (Carrier SCAC Reference Identification Qualifier) in September 2024.

## SDK Adapter Recommendations

### Feasibility Assessment

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Can we build a useful adapter?** | Yes — MSC implements DCSA TNT v2.2 and Commercial Schedules, providing comprehensive tracking and schedule data. |
| **Implementation effort** | **Medium** (DCSA with minor deviations) — MSC follows DCSA TNT v2.2, but the Azure Service Bus subscription model adds complexity. Polling via `GET /v2/events` is straightforward. |
| **DCSA base adapter usable?** | Yes with overrides — the TNT v2.2 polling endpoints follow the standard closely. Subscription/push handling needs MSC-specific Azure Service Bus implementation. |

### Recommended Approach

MSC's Track and Trace API follows DCSA TNT v2.2, making it a strong candidate for a DCSA base adapter. The adapter should:

1. **Use the DCSA base adapter** for event polling (`GET /v2/events`), event parsing, and field mapping. Since MSC claims full DCSA compliance, the standard DCSA event model should map directly.

2. **Override the subscription/push mechanism** to handle Azure Service Bus instead of standard HTTP webhooks. This is the most significant MSC-specific deviation.

3. **Add a Commercial Schedules module** for cutoff data and route information, following the DCSA Commercial Schedules API pattern.

4. **Fall back to polling** for the initial implementation, as polling is simpler, universally supported by DCSA carriers, and doesn't require Azure Service Bus infrastructure. Push via Azure Service Bus can be added as a v2 enhancement.

5. **Handle DCSA TNT v2.2 specifics**: The adapter must account for v2.2 event model differences from v3.0 (combined vs. separated event types).

### Recommended Lookup Method

**Bill of Lading (transportDocumentReference)** is recommended as the primary lookup method. B/L numbers are the most universal identifier in ocean shipping, work across transshipments, and return the complete shipment event history. Container number (`equipmentReference`) is a good secondary lookup for FCL shipments. Booking reference (`carrierBookingReference`) is useful for pre-sailing tracking before a B/L is issued.

### Recommended Polling Strategy

| **Polling interval** | Every 2–4 hours for active shipments. Rate limits are unpublished, so start conservative. |
| **Incremental filter** | Use `eventCreatedDateTime:gte={lastPollTime}` to retrieve only new events since last poll. DCSA TNT v2.2 supports this parameter. |
| **Batch tracking** | One API call per shipment (DCSA events endpoint filters by individual document/equipment reference). No batch multi-shipment endpoint in DCSA v2.2. Consider parallelizing calls with rate limiting. |

### Auth Implementation Notes

Authentication details are not publicly documented. During onboarding, MSC will provide:
- Credential type and format (likely OAuth2 client credentials or API key)
- Token endpoint (if OAuth2)
- Token lifetime and refresh mechanism
- Any required headers or query parameters

The adapter's auth module should be designed to accept configurable credentials with a pluggable auth strategy pattern, allowing the specific mechanism to be implemented once MSC provides the details during onboarding.

### Edge Cases to Handle

- **Azure Service Bus push**: If push is implemented, the adapter needs Azure Service Bus client library (`@azure/service-bus`) for consuming messages. This is non-standard for a DCSA adapter.
- **DCSA v2.2 vs v3.0 event model**: v2.2 uses combined event types with `eventType` field (SHIPMENT/TRANSPORT/EQUIPMENT). If the SDK's canonical model is based on v3.0 (which separates these), a mapping layer is needed.
- **Internal codes alongside standard codes**: MSC uses some internal codes alongside SMDG/BIC standards. The adapter should pass through unknown codes and log them for investigation.
- **Transshipment identification**: In DCSA v2.2, transshipment events must be inferred from port sequence in the transport plan, not from explicit flags.
- **Booking API availability uncertainty**: The adapter should gracefully handle 404 or unavailable booking endpoints if DCSA Booking 2.0 is not yet live.
- **Akamai protection**: Any fallback web scraping strategy for MSC is not viable due to aggressive CDN protection.

### Mapping Complexity

**Low to Medium**. MSC implements DCSA TNT v2.2, which closely matches our canonical data model (since the model is based on DCSA). The main mapping work is:

1. **v2.2 → v3.0 event model translation** (if our canonical model uses v3.0 structure)
2. **Internal code handling** for facility/terminal codes not in SMDG/BIC
3. **Cutoff data extraction** from Commercial Schedules response into our cutoff model
4. **Azure Service Bus message parsing** for push notifications (if implemented)

## Open Questions

- [ ] **Does SSL have an existing MSC business relationship?** This would simplify the Direct Integration onboarding process.
- [ ] **Is MSC's DCSA Booking 2.0 API now live?** It was planned for end of 2025 — need to verify current status during onboarding.
- [ ] **What is MSC's authentication mechanism?** OAuth2, API key, or something else? Only determinable during onboarding.
- [ ] **What are MSC's actual rate limits?** Unpublished — need to discover during onboarding or empirically during testing.
- [ ] **Does MSC's TNT v2.2 implementation deviate from the DCSA spec?** Their FAQ mentions internal codes. Full deviation list only available after API access.
- [ ] **Is Azure Service Bus the only push delivery option?** Or does MSC also support standard HTTP webhooks? The developer portal only mentions Service Bus.
- [ ] **What test data is available in the sandbox?** The FAQ says "predefined set of production-like mock data" — need to evaluate coverage.
- [ ] **Is the iReefer Ultimate API relevant for SSL?** Only applicable if SSL ships refrigerated cargo via MSC.
- [ ] **Does MSC charge per-API-call or flat-rate?** The FAQ mentions "fees may apply" but no pricing model is published.
- [ ] **Has MSC's TradeLens data been migrated to DCSA APIs?** TradeLens was shut down in 2023 — any historical data may only be in MSC's own systems.
